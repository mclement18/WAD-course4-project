# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)


# percent_q_string is used in a tip below
percent_q_string = %Q(It's possible to create a String on multiple lines using %Q( ... ).

By defining the String in %Q, a String can span several lines.

This is just basic "newline" markers and won't convert to new lines in HTML, which needs the use
of <br /> or more appropriate markup.)
